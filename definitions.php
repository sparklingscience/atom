        <h2>Maker</h2>
        <p>Although makers can be anyone, more inveterate makers are part of the maker subculture, which includes engineering-oriented pursuits such as electronics, robotics, 3-D printing, and the use of CNC tools, as well as more traditional activities such as metalworking, woodworking, and traditional arts and crafts. Thanks to the increasing accesibility, openness and modularity of technology</p>
<hr />
<h2>Makerspaces</h2>
<p>A maker space, also called hacker space or fablab, is a community space where people can go to tinker with technology, learn from others and make awesome stuff. A maker space is often funded by it's members through an annual fee and is based on the inclusive and collaborative culture of open source hardware, encouraging knowledge sharing, learning and sharing.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Make-a-thons </h2>
<p>A make-a-thon is an event that gathers people from different backgrounds to converge on a collaborative process of designing solutions to problems. Participants at make-a-thons are a diverse gathering of people, often a mix of engineers, designers, artists and practitioners with their own unique perspective, all contributing to a creative soup of interdisciplinary collaboration and awesomeness. </p>
